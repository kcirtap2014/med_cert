Project: Medical certificates validation
P. Lee, J. Deraze

This project applies pytesseract to extract text from a medical certificate image, and identifying necessary keywords from the text, such as first name, surname, validity date and discipline with the word 'compétition'.

Approach:
Part 1: pytesseract (>50% certificates can be correctly identified)
Part 2: segmentation + CRNN

Folders:
--------
- Article: contains all article references for this project
- TestCertificats: contains all test certificates
- pdf: converted test certificates from jpeg, jpg, and png to pdf
- img_data: images after the segmentation process.

Files:
------
- main.py: process certificates using pytesseract (@Jérôme)
- evaluation.py: evaluate the performance after part 1
- segmentation.py: segment remaining certificates that cannot be correctly processed using pytesseract (@Jérôme)
- helper_functions.py: contain functions that support other .py files
- retained_file_score_n: files that are issued from evaluation.py, contain a list of certicficate links that have corresponding n score
- df_res.csv: result dataframe, issued from main.py

(@Jérôme) --> thresholding and filtering can be done in these files
